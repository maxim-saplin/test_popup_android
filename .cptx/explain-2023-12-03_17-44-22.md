The error you're encountering is due to a type mismatch. The `map` method is expected to transform each item in the iterable to a new form, and you're attempting to transform each entry into a list of `TextSpan` objects. However, the `expand` method is then flattening these lists into a single iterable of `TextSpan` objects, which is correct, but the type annotation in the `map` call is incorrect.

The `map` method should not have the type `<List<TextSpan>>` because you're not transforming each entry into a `List<TextSpan>`, but rather into an iterable of `TextSpan` which is then flattened. The type annotation is causing Dart to expect a `List<TextSpan>` to be returned from the `map` method, which is not the case.

Here's how you can fix the code:

```dart
var y = x
  .map(
    (entry) => [
      TextSpan(
        text: '${entry.key}: ',
        style: const TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
      ),
      TextSpan(
        text: '${entry.value}\n',
        style: const TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.normal),
      ),
    ],
  )
  .expand<TextSpan>((i) => i)
  .toList();
```

By removing the incorrect type annotation `<List<TextSpan>>` from the `map` call, the code should now work as expected, transforming each entry into two `TextSpan` objects and then flattening the result into a list of `TextSpan` objects.

#### Request:
Why do I get this error?      Unhandled exception: type 'CastIterable<MapEntry<Object?, Object?>, MapEntry<String, String>>' is not a subtype of type 'List<TextSpan>'

#### Selected code:
```var y = x
              .map<List<TextSpan>>(
                (entry) => [
                  TextSpan(
                    text: '${entry.key}: ',
                    style: const TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                  ),
                  TextSpan(
                    text: '${entry.value}\n',
                    style: const TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.normal),
                  ),
                ],
              )
              .expand<TextSpan>((i) => i)
              .toList();```
